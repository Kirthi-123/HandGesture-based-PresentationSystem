# HandGesture-based-PresentationSystem
This project enables touchless control of presentations using hand gestures detected through a webcam. By leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, it recognizes gestures such as swiping left or right to navigate slides, pinching to zoom, and detecting both hands for additional functionalities.
