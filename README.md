# HandGesture-based-PresentationSystem
This project enables touchless control of presentations using hand gestures detected through a webcam. By leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, it recognizes gestures such as swiping left or right to navigate slides, pinching to zoom, and detecting both hands for additional functionalities.

🚀 Control your presentations using hand gestures! This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to recognize gestures and interact with presentation software like PowerPoint and Google Slides.

# 📌 Features
✅ Swipe Left → Move to the previous slide

✅ Swipe Right → Move to the next slide

✅ Pinch Gesture → Zoom in

✅ Open Hand Gesture → Zoom out

✅ Customizable Actions → Modify gestures for different functionalities


## 🛠 Technologies Used
OpenCV → Captures video from the webcam

MediaPipe → Hand tracking and gesture recognition

PyAutoGUI → Simulates keyboard shortcuts to control slides

NumPy → Computes distances for gesture detection
